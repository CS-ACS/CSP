2. Follow the [instructions]({{ "/robotics/loops/clawbot.pdf" | relative_url }}) to build the Clawbot IQ. You'll follow chapters 1 and 2 (pages 4-27) in teams of 2-3. 
    * Make sure that the controller is paired for a wireless connection (instructions are in the orange booklet). 
    * Ensure all of the functions of the basebot are working (driving, turning, and lifting). 
    * This should take one class period.
3. Return spare parts and do your best to keep parts organized (i.e., like parts are together).
4. Take some pictures and answer the following reflection questions on Google Classroom:
    * What do you notice about the construction of the basebot as compared to your independently developed machines in the last two projects? Give at least two specific examples and. Identify at least two specific parts of the basebot that employ ideas you could use in future projects. For each example you describe, include at least one picture.
