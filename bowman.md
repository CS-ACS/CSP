About Mr. Bowman

I am the father of twin 4-year-old girls that were born in Jordan, where my family has lived since 2016. I was born in Kansas and lived most of my life in Colorado in the United States, and spent 9 years living abroad in Jordan, Kuwait and South Korea. Other than Computer Science, I teach or have taught English, film appreciation, audio and video production, and photography, which reflects the fact that I've always had broad interests, ranging from literature to music to technology to film, and I enjoy learning new skills, tinkering, and fixing things.Â
