# Unit 2.1: `Quotient`


## Specification
Implement a program in C in a file named `quotient.c` with the following behavior:
- Get two integers from the user called the `dividend` and the `divisor`.
- Print the _floored quotient_ (result of floor division) __AND__ the _remainder_ (result of the modulo (%) operation) of that division. This is the result you would get from doing long division.
- Print the _quotient_ (result of floating point division) to 3 decimal places.
- You don't need to handle invalid inputs or include any comments for this assignment.
