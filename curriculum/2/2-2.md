# 2.2: Quotient

{% include cs50player.html id=page.videoId timestamp=page.timestamp %}

### Watch the Chapter 2 lecture from 35:37 to 1:06:54 and answer the questions below.
1. What are data types? Provide examples. 
2. What does it mean to _cast_ data/variables?
3. Describe the various changes Malan makes to scores.c
4. What is an array?

Submit to Google Classroom.

Then, implement a program in C (use the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/)) in a file named `quotient.c` with the following behavior:
- Get two integers from the user called the `dividend` and the `divisor`.
- Print the _floored quotient_ (result of floor division) and the remainder of that division. This is the result you would get from doing long division.
- Print the _quotient_ (result of floating point division) to 3 decimal places.
- You don't need to handle invalid inputs or include any comments for this assignment.

__Example in/out:__
```
dividend: 8
divisor: 3
floored quotient: 2
remainder: 2
quotient: 2.667

```

```
dividend: 9
divisor: 3
floored quotient: 3
remainder: 0
quotient: 3.000

```

```
dividend: 99
divisor: 25
floored quotient: 3
remainder: 24
quotient: 3.960

```

```
dividend: 99
divisor: 0
Floating point exception
