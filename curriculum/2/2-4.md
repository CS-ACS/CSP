# 2.4: Cash2

{% include cs50player.html id=page.videoId timestamp=page.timestamp %}

### Watch the Chapter 2 lecture from 1:35:00 to 1:43:00 and answer the questions below.
1. What is `int argc`?
2. What is `string argv[]`
3. What does the `'int` signify in the line `int main(void)`? Why is it there?

Submit to Google Classroom.

Then, implement a program in a file called `cash2.c` that does exactly the same thing as `cash.c` from Chapter 1, but takes a command line argument instead of `get_float()`. Instead of rejecting and re-prompting when an invalid input (anything other than a single float) is received, the program should inform the user why the input was invalid and exit with an _exit code_ of `1`. If the program executes successfully, it should exist with an _exit code_ of `0`. You'll need to convert the argument, which is a string, using `[atof()](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_atof.htm)` in order for the rest of your program to work. If `atof()` cannot convert (i.e. the user enters letters instead of numbers), it will return `0.0`. If there are invalid characters after a float, `atof()` will ignore them.

__Example in/out:__

```
$ ./cash2 0.41
4
```
```
$ ./cash2 0.01
1
```
```
$ ./cash2 0.15
2
```
```
$ ./cash2 23
92
```
```
$ ./cash2 1 2
Usage: cash2 positive_float
```
```
$ ./cash2
Usage: cash2 positive_float
```
```
$ ./cash2 -0.41
Usage: cash2 positive_float
```
